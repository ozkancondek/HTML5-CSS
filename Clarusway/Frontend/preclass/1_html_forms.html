         The Method Attribute
The method attribute is used to determine how to send form data to the server.

There are two types of method to sent forms: GET and POST.

The default value for the method attribute is GET method. If the method attribute is omitted, the form data will be sent using the GET method.

With the GET method, the values from the form data will be visible in the page address field. So, GET method must not be used for sensitive data.

If the form is short and not sensitive, it is ideal to use GET method.

In case the form is very long and contains sensitive data (e.g. passwords), to use POST method is ideal.
